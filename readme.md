Store Visitor
=============

When a new user registers with [Zoo Visitor](http://ee-zoo.com/add-ons/visitor/) and [Exp-resso Store](https://www.exp-resso.com/) is installed this will update the Store orders member_id to match the new user registered. The match is based on email address which is recorded for Store Orders.

Installation
------------

Simply drop the store_visitor folder in your /system/expressionengine/third_party/ folder (or wherever you have your add-ons installed).

Navigate to your Extensions in the Control Panel and activate the extension by clicking "Install" next to the Store Visitor extension.

Have a cup of coffee - you just made your clients e-commerce easier to manage.
